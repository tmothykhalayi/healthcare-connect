### FILE HANDLING IMPLEMENTATION NOTE
### ------------------------------------------

# Based on the 404 errors received, it appears that file handling endpoints
# are not yet implemented in this API. Below is a recommendation for 
# how to implement this functionality.

### To implement file uploads for medical records, you would need:
### 1. A dedicated FileModule/AttachmentsModule
### 2. File storage service (local or cloud-based)
### 3. API endpoints for upload/download/delete operations
### 4. Database tables to track file metadata

# See implementation details below in the comments section
